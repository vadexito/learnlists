<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Learnlists collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Learnlists&#8217;s 	purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Learnlists&#8217;s visitors use its website. From time to 	time, Learnlists may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its 	website.</p>
<p>Learnlists also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Learnlists does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and 	discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>

<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to Learnlists's website choose to interact with Learnlists in ways that require Learnlists to gather personally-identifying 	information. The amount and type of information that Learnlists gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who 	sign up for an account at <a href="http://quizlet.com/">Learnlists</a> to provide a username, date of birth, and email address. Those who engage 	in financial transactions with Learnlists are asked to provide additional information, such as name and credit card number. In each case, Learnlists 	collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Learnlists. Learnlists 	does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-	identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>
<p>For children under 13, Learnlists offers a limited feature set and web site experience.  We require consent from a parent when children under 	the age of 13 want to register on Learnlists and offer a limited version of the website that removes certain social features. The only 	identifiable information we collect from children under 13 is a parent’s email address.</p>

<h3>Safety on Learnlists</h3>
<p>Children’s safety and full enjoyment of Learnlists, as well as the safety and well being for all children and their families, is of the utmost 	importance to all of us at Learnlists. Learnlists does not accumulate personal information about any child or family for distribution, sharing, or 	selling except as described in this privacy policy. We only keep an email on file for notifying parents of their child's wish to join Learnlists.</p>

<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>Learnlists may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. For instance, Learnlists may monitor the most popular word sets 	on the Learnlists site. Learnlists may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Learnlists does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h3>How We Handle Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>Learnlists discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and 	affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Learnlists's behalf or to provide services available at 	Learnlists's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations 	may be located outside of your home country; by using Learnlists's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Learnlists will 	not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors 	and affiliated organizations, as described above, Learnlists discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information 	only when required to do so by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or when Learnlists believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably 	necessary to protect the property or rights of Learnlists, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Learnlists website 	and have supplied your email address, Learnlists may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just 	keep you up to date with what's going on with Learnlists and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of 	information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our 	feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other 	users. Learnlists takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of 	potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. You may choose to stop receiving our email by updating your email 	settings within your profile or you can contact us at <a href="http://quizlet.com/feedback" target="_blank">quizlet.com/feedback</a>.</p>

<h3>Parental Rights</h3>
<p>Parents and legal guardians of children under 13 who are members of Learnlists.com have certain rights under COPPA, and Learnlists recognizes 	those rights. Parents/guardians can consent to collection and use of a child's personally identifiable information (PII) without consenting to 	the disclosure of information to third parties. Currently the only identifiable information we collect from children under 13 is parent's email 	address.</p>
<p>Parents/guardians can review information their children have contributed to Learnlists.com, by accessing their child's account (login 	instructions are included in the "Direct Notice" email sent to all parents/guardians following their under 13 child's registration on Learnlists). 	Parents can also request that Learnlists delete that information and refuse to allow Learnlists to collect further information from their children by 	contacting our Customer Service department at <a href="http://quizlet.com/feedback" class="pjax" target="_blank">quizlet.com/feedback</a>. Learnlists may ask 	additional questions or take other steps to verify the identity of parents/guardians before responding to a request to review or delete their 	child's information, or a request to refuse further collection from children.</p>
<p>A child's participation or access to an activity on Learnlists cannot be conditioned on him or her providing more information than is 	reasonably necessary for that activity, or any personally identifiable information. Learnlists does not collect personally identifiable 	information from children under 13, without a parent or guardian's consent.</p>

<p>Certain activity on Learnlists may be displayed to other users, such as posts to Learnlists discussion boards or our blog, or the information on 	your Learnlists Profile. This information includes your username, class names, and statistics.</p>
