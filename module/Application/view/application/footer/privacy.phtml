        <p>“Learnlists” is a service offered by <?php echo $companyName; ?>, <?php echo $companyAddress; ?>. Through this privacy statement, <?php echo $companyName; ?> wishes to inform you of how your personal data are processed and in what form some of these data are made accessible for other users. All personal data are treated with the utmost care at <?php echo $companyName; ?>. All the necessary steps are taken to guarantee the security of these data. This privacy statement supplements the General Terms and Conditions of Business of Learnlists. Please write to <a href="mailto://<?php echo $infoEmail; ?>"><?php echo $infoEmail; ?></a> if you have any queries relating to this document.</p>
        <h3 id="whichdataarestored">1. Which data are stored?</h3>
        <h4 id="personaldata">1.1 Personal data</h4>
        <p>When you register with us, we record and save your basic data such as e-mail address together with other contact information such as user name and password. We may receive further information from you via the website (e.g. if you fill in your personal profile) or if you communicate with us.</p>
        <p>The following registration data are accessible for other Learnlists users:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>selected language</li>
        </ul>
        <p>[update]Other data provided voluntarily are also generally accessible for other users of Learnlists; however, you can disable such access at <a href="<?php echo $userEditUrl; ?>"><?php echo $userEditUrl; ?></a>. This concerns first name, surname, gender, age and any other voluntary details that you can save in your profile.</p>
        <h4 id="cookies">1.2 Cookies</h4>
        <p>After you have logged in (with user name or email address and password), Learnlists uses cookies with which you can be identified for the duration of your visit. Cookies are small files stored on your computer which providing data. Other technologies such as pixel tags, web bugs, web storage and similar files fulfil the same purpose. A cookie is saved on your computer.</p>
        <p>One type of cookie automatically expires after your session has ended. This is called a session cookie. Your user settings, in particular, are saved as session cookies so that Learnlists can always be used in the form you require. When you log in, you also have the option of saving you user name and password locally in encrypted form on your computer. You can save this cookie permanently for automatic log in with the function “Log me in automatically on this computer”. In addition to this, user settings, such as language selection, language recognition settings, user IDs for various applications, are saved in both session cookies and permanent cookies by Learnlists in order to facilitate the use of Learnlists.</p>
        <p>You switch off the use of cookies for our website or in general in the settings of your Internet browser. You can find out how this functions from the website of your Internet browser supplier. For the Internet Explorer you can find the relevant instructions at <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/de-DE/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies">http://windows.microsoft.com/de-DE/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies</a>, for Firefox at <a href="http://support.mozilla.org/de/kb/cookies-erlauben-und-ablehnen">http://support.mozilla.org/de/kb/cookies-erlauben-und-ablehnen</a>, for Apple Safari at <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/index?page=search&amp;fac=all&amp;q=cookies%20safari">http://support.apple.com/kb/index?page=search&amp;fac=all&amp;q=cookies%20safari</a> and for Google Chrome at <a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=de&amp;answer=95647">http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=de&amp;answer=95647</a>.</p>
        <p>However, deactivating cookies will mean that a number of functionalities, e.g. automatically logging in to the website, will no longer operate as intended.</p>
        <h4 id="logfiles">1.3 Log files</h4>
        <p>Each time a page is called up, access data are saved in a protocol file, the server log. The data record thus saved contains the following data:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>your IP address (by means of which your computer can be unambiguously identified)</li>
        <li>the remote host (name and IP address of the computer requesting the page)</li>
        <li>the time, the status, the quantity of data transferred and the Internet page from which you accessed the requested page (referrer)</li>
        <li>The product and version information of the browser used (user agent)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><?php echo $companyName; ?> uses a standardized webserver logfile format for this purpose. Provided these data are not urgently required for the technical maintenance of the system or for the system security, they are anonymized instantly and the original protocols are deleted. Anonymization takes place by removal or truncation of the IP address by allocating a code not assigned to a user. Any allocation to an identified or identifiable person is therefore no longer possible. <?php echo $companyName; ?> therefore uses the protocol data (logs) exclusively in anonymized form for statistical evaluations, hence without any allocation or references to your personal details. In this way, <?php echo $companyName; ?> determines, for instance, on which days and at which times Learnlists is particularly popular and what volume of data is generated on the Learnlists web servers. Furthermore, <?php echo $companyName; ?> can detect possible errors through the log files, e.g. faulty links or program errors, and thus use the log files for the ongoing development and refinement of Learnlists. <?php echo $companyName; ?> does not link the page requests and usage information to individual persons.</p>
        <h4 id="googleanalytics">1.4 Google Analytics</h4>
        <p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyse how you use the site. As anonymization is activated for the data we collect, your IP address is truncated by Google within member states of the European Union or in other signatory countries to the Treaty creating the European Economic Area and only then is it transferred to the USA.</p>
        <p>Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and truncated there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website in order to compile reports on website activity for the website operator and to provide other services relating to website activity and Internet usage. The IP address transferred by your browser within the scope of Google Analytics will not be combined with other data from Google.</p>
        <p>You may prevent the saving of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser; however, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. Furthermore, you can prevent the data captured by the cookie and relating to your use of the website (incl. your IP address) from being captured and processed by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>.</p>
        <p>Further information on the use of the data and privacy policy at Google Analytics is available at <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html">http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>. Learnlists.de uses Google Analytics exclusively in connection with the “gat._anonymizeIp();” extension so that IP addresses are only recorded in truncated, i.e. anonymized form.</p>
        <h4 id="personalvocabulary">1.5 Personal vocabulary</h4>
        <p>To enable Learnlists users to conveniently learn with their chosen lists, all practised lists together with all results of lists are saved in the user’s personal record. These data can be viewed by other users only in the form of high scores, which do not indicate which specific words or sentences are being practised but merely reveal how many exercises have been successfully completed.</p>
        <h4 id="imageuploadsandimagescores">1.6 Image uploads and image scores</h4>
        <p>Learnlists users can upload images for general use .</p>
        <h4 id="messages">1.7 Messages</h4>
        <p>All private messages between Learnlists users via the Learnlists website are saved on the Learnlists servers. These private data are not made accessible to other users under any circumstances. The messages are deleted as soon as both communicating parties have deleted them from their mailboxes. Public messages in discussion forums are saved permanently provided you do not delete them yourself. The files remain saved even after you have terminated the service. Other users are able to recognize whether you take part in any activities within the discussion forum. Users with whom you are friends may also receive a message about your activities.</p>
        <h3 id="purposeofstoringthedata">2. Purpose of storing the data</h3>
        <p>The purpose of gathering, saving, processing and using the data is solely to facilitate, maintain and develop the “Learnlists” service provided by <?php echo $companyName; ?>. In particular, part of the ongoing development involves the use of anonymous statistics on the usage of the services. Movement profiles of individual users on the website are not created. The data are not used for any other purposes.</p>
        <h3 id="noforwardingofdatatothirdparties">3. No forwarding of data to third parties</h3>
        <p><?php echo $companyName; ?> does not forward the personal data of its users to third parties unless the user has given his/her explicit consent or there is a legal requirement to forward the data. In the case of payment processing, the data for processing the payment transaction are forwarded to the payment services provider if you do not supply the data directly. If you send your payment data directly to the payment services provider, we receive only very limited data. In such cases, we are merely informed whether or not the transaction relating to a specific transaction number has actually taken place. In such cases we do not receive your account data. If any third-party rights have been violated (in particular rights relating to copyright, trademarks, names and symbols) by the user, the user data will not be forwarded to the rights holder unless the latter conclusively demonstrates his/her claims to <?php echo $companyName; ?>.</p>
        <h3 id="minors">4. Minors</h3>
        <p>As a matter of principle, Learnlists is directed towards users who have reached the age of majority. Any use by minors without the consent of their legal guardians is prohibited. <?php echo $companyName; ?> therefore reserves the right to delete all data relating to underage users if no consent from the legal guardians is available.</p>
        <h3 id="datasecurity">5. Data security</h3>
        <p><?php echo $companyName; ?> employs safety precautions to guarantee that your data are protected against loss, modification or misuse. To this end, <?php echo $companyName; ?> works with constantly updated firewalls meeting the industry standard as well as other security systems. At the same time, the user should be aware of the fact that one hundred per cent protection against attacks cannot be guaranteed because of the continual appearance of new viruses and other means of attacking the protected data systems of Internet services. <?php echo $companyName; ?> will instigate civil and criminal proceedings against any attack by hackers and the like and will inform the users of any cases in which their data have been compromised.</p>
        <h3 id="informationcorrectionanddeletion">6. Information, correction and deletion</h3>
        <h4 id="righttoinformationonstoreddata">6.1 Right to information on stored data</h4>
        <p>Every user has the right to obtain information from <?php echo $companyName; ?> on the personal data that has been saved in relation to him/her. If the request for information is not conveyed to <?php echo $companyName; ?> in writing, hence particularly in the case of enquiries by telephone or e-mail, the user must provide a postal address to which the information can then be sent. In the request for information, the user must additionally provide the following details for identification purposes: user name, first name and surname, maiden name (if appropriate), e-mail address, postal address and date of birth. The information is sent by post to the address provided by the user.</p>
        <h4 id="corrections">6.2 Corrections</h4>
        <p>If the user alters or corrects the details that he/she has provided and deletes old entries, the data previously entered by the user will be completely deleted automatically. An application for correction or deletion is not required. You can edit your personal data at any time at <a href="<?php echo $userEditUrl; ?>"><?php echo $userEditUrl; ?></a>. This notwithstanding, the user has the right at all times to demand the correction of any inaccurate data concerning him/her stored with Learnlists. However, the easiest option is for users to correct any such entries themselves.</p>
        <h4 id="deletionofdata">6.3 Deletion of data</h4>
        <p>Should the user demand any alteration, correction or deletion of his/her personal data, this may take place by e-mail or letter. To ensure correct identification of the user, the request must at least contain the following details:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>User name</li>
        <li>E-mail address</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note that due to caching systems, search engines, the interposition of proxy servers and the like, deleted data may continue to remain accessible even though they are no longer present within our systems.</p>
        <h3 id="contact">7. Contact</h3>
        <p>The trust of our users is important to us. <?php echo $companyName; ?> therefore wishes to provide its users with full information on the processing of their personal data at all times. If any queries remain unanswered by this privacy statement or if more detailed information is required on any point, please contact the following address at any time:</p>
