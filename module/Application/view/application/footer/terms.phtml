        <p>[update needed]Consequences of CancellationIn case of a valid cancellation the benefits exchanged between the parties have to be returned and possible utilisations (including interests) are to be handed over. If you are unable to return the benefits and utilisations (e.g. any benefits of use) or if you can only return those in part or only in a degraded state, you will have to indemnify us. This may result in you having to pay the contractual payment for the period until your cancellation. Obligations to return any payments are to be fulfilled within 30 days. The period begins for you with sending the cancellation and for us with its receipt. Special advise:Your cancellation right ends earlier, when the contract has been fulfilled completely at your express request, prior to you exercising your cancellation right. End of the cancellation information according to Annex 1 of Article 246 “Money-back Guarantee” applies in addition to the mandatory cancellation right without any further requirement.</p>
